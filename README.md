# Kingdom series (Netflix)

**Kingdom (Japanese: キングダム, Hepburn: Kingudamu)** is a 2019 Japanese historical action film directed by Shinsuke Sato and produced by Sony Pictures Japan.

It is an adaptation of the manga series of the same name, created by Yasuhisa Hara and published by Shueisha. The screenplay was written by Tsutomu Kuroiwa, Shinsuke Sato and Yasuhisa Hara. Kento Yamazaki, who starred in a 3-minute short of the same name released in 2016, reprises his role as the film's protagonist with a supporting cast that includes Ryo Yoshizawa, Kanna Hashimoto, Masami Nagasawa, Kanata Hongō and Takao Osawa.

The film portrays the life of Li Xin, a general of Qin, from his childhood as an orphan through his military career during the Warring States period of ancient China.

Movie in correct order:
1. Kingdom
2. Kingdom 2: Far and Away
3. Kingdom III: The Flame of Destiny

Absolute thrill of a movie and is a must watch for those who like historical movies/series like myself.
